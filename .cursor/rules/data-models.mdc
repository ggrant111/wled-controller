## Core Data Models (Importance: 95/100)

1. LED Device Model
- Physical and virtual LED device definitions
- Segment mappings and address ranges
- Brightness and color calibration parameters
- Protocol configuration (DDP/UDP)

2. Effect Model
- Effect type definitions and parameters 
- Layer compositing and blending rules
- Real-time frame generation settings
- Parameter inheritance schema

3. Device Groups
- Hierarchical group structures
- Segment-level grouping rules
- Partial device inclusion mappings
- Reference validation constraints

4. Effect Palettes
- Color palette definitions
- Interpolation parameters
- FastLED compatibility formats
- Dynamic generation rules

## Relationships

1. Device-Segment Mapping
- One-to-many relationship between devices and segments
- Overlapping segment validation
- Range conflict detection
- Virtual-to-physical mappings

2. Group-Device Association
- Many-to-many relationship between groups and devices
- Segment-level inclusion rules
- Circular reference prevention
- Inheritance hierarchy

3. Effect-Layer Binding
- One-to-many relationship between effects and layers
- Parameter override mechanics
- Blend mode definitions
- Real-time update constraints

## Domain Entities

1. LED Segments
- Start/end address ranges
- Color order (RGB/GRB/etc)
- Brightness scaling
- Direction (forward/reverse)

2. Effect Parameters
- Type-specific parameter sets
- Default value definitions
- Valid range constraints
- Real-time update flags

3. Stream Targets
- Protocol configurations
- Address mappings
- Timeout settings
- Activity indicators
