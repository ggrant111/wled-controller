## Core Device Models
Importance Score: 95

Device representation hierarchy that models physical and virtual LED arrangements:
- LEDDevice: Base model for physical WLED-compatible devices
  - deviceId: Unique identifier
  - segments: Array of LED ranges
  - virtualMappings: Segment-to-virtual device relationships
- VirtualDevice: Logical grouping of LED segments
  - virtualId: Unique identifier
  - mappedSegments: References to physical device segments
  - effectParameters: Active effect configuration

## Effect System Models 
Importance Score: 90

Effect configuration and parameter models:
- Effect: Template for LED animations
  - effectId: Unique identifier
  - parameters: Dynamic parameter collection
  - blendMode: Compositing rules for layering
- EffectLayer: Instance of effect with specific parameters
  - opacity: Layer transparency
  - parameterValues: Current parameter state
  - targetSegments: Affected LED ranges

## Segment Models
Importance Score: 85

LED segment organization and grouping:
- Segment: Continuous range of LEDs
  - startIndex: First LED in range
  - length: Number of LEDs
  - virtualAssignments: Parent virtual devices
- Group: Collection of segments
  - groupId: Unique identifier
  - segments: Member segment references
  - activeEffects: Currently running effects

## Palette Models
Importance Score: 80

Color management system:
- ColorPalette: Collection of colors for effects
  - paletteId: Unique identifier
  - colors: Array of RGB values
  - interpolationMode: Blending method
- PaletteTransition: Rules for color changes
  - sourceColors: Starting palette
  - targetColors: Ending palette
  - transitionType: Interpolation method
