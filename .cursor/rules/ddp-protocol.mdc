# ddp-protocol

Importance Score: 85/100

## Core Protocol Implementation

DDP (Distributed Display Protocol) for LED control implements:
- Custom packet framing for real-time LED data streaming
- Segment-based addressing with brightness control
- Multi-target streaming coordination
- Frame synchronization across device groups

## Packet Structure
1. Header Section
- Protocol version identifier
- Segment addressing information
- Device target ID
- Brightness scaling factor

2. Payload Section
- LED color data in RGB format
- Segment mapping information
- Frame sequence numbers
- Control flags for device synchronization

## Streaming Optimizations
- Packet chunking for large LED arrays
- Segment-based updates for partial frame transmission
- Frame rate control (30-120 FPS)
- Real-time parameter updates during active streams

## Device Integration
- Virtual device mapping to physical segments
- Synchronized control across multiple targets
- Dynamic reconfiguration support
- Stream status monitoring

The protocol focuses on efficient real-time LED control with support for:
- Multi-device coordination
- Segment-level addressing
- Dynamic brightness control
- Frame synchronization
