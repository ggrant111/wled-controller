## Virtual Device Mapping

Key components handling logical-to-physical device relationships:

1. LED Segment Allocation
- Maps virtual LED ranges to physical device segments 
- Handles overlapping LED range detection
- Validates segment boundaries and device constraints
- Manages dynamic reconfiguration of LED mappings

2. Group Synchronization
- Implements hierarchical device grouping structure
- Controls partial device inclusion in groups
- Prevents circular group references
- Coordinates segment-level device synchronization

3. Device Configuration
- Virtual device creation with customizable ranges
- LED segment validation and conflict resolution
- Real-time device mapping updates
- Group-based device management

Core workflows:

1. Virtual Device Creation
- Range mapping configuration
- Segment allocation validation
- Overlap conflict detection
- Physical device linking

2. Group Management  
- Hierarchical device organization
- Segment-level grouping
- Group configuration validation
- Multi-device synchronization

The device management system focuses on maintaining relationships between virtual and physical LED devices while ensuring proper synchronization through hierarchical grouping structures.
