Virtual Device Management (Importance Score: 85)
- LED range mapping system for composing virtual devices from physical segments
- Segment overlap detection and validation logic
- Distribution management for LED assignments across multiple physical devices

Device Group Synchronization (Importance Score: 80)
- Synchronized control mechanisms for device clusters
- Segment-level coordination within grouped devices
- Cross-device effect propagation handling

Device Segment Management (Importance Score: 75)
Files: components/VirtualDeviceModal.tsx
- Virtual LED segment definition and boundary management
- Mapping tables for physical-to-logical device relationships
- Real-time segment state synchronization

Key Domain Models:
1. Virtual Device Structure
- Segment definitions with start/end mappings
- Physical device references
- Group membership attributes

2. Device Groups
- Synchronized control parameters
- Member device registry
- Segment-level effect coordination

3. LED Range Mapping
- Physical-to-virtual LED index translation
- Segment overlap resolution
- Cross-device LED distribution

Business Rules:
- Virtual devices must have unique segment ranges
- Group effects apply uniformly across member devices
- Segment boundaries cannot overlap within single virtual device
- Physical device segments maintain independent state tracking
