# led-effects-engine

Importance Score: 90/100

## Effect Generation System
- Real-time LED effect computation pipeline
- Multi-layer blending system supporting 12 blend modes
- Effect parameter interpolation and inheritance
- Frame generation with concurrent effect support

## Core Effect Types
1. Dynamic Effects
- Rainbow: Continuous color cycling with speed control
- Comet: Moving light trail with configurable tail decay
- Fire: Dynamic flame simulation with intensity parameters
- Matrix: Falling character animation with custom symbols

2. Static Effects  
- Color Wipe: Progressive color filling
- Breathing: Smooth brightness pulsing
- Wave: Sinusoidal color movement
- Twinkle: Random LED sparkle patterns

## Layer Processing
- Hierarchical layer management
- Opacity-based blending between effects
- Parameter override system
- Real-time layer reordering

## Effect Parameters
- Color palette management
- Speed and intensity controls
- Direction and movement patterns
- Segment targeting and mapping

## Frame Generation
- Synchronized frame timing
- WebSocket-based streaming
- Frame rate management (30-120 FPS)
- Multi-target frame distribution

## Effect Presets
- Parameter grouping and storage
- Hot-reload support during active streams
- Preset inheritance system
- Real-time parameter updates
