# led-effects-engine

The LED effects engine implements a multi-layered animation system for controlling LED light displays:

## Core Effect Processing (Importance Score: 95)
- Layer-based effect composition with real-time blending
- Frame generation pipeline supporting multiple output targets
- Effect parameter interpolation and hot-reloading
- Complex blend modes including multiply, screen, overlay

## Effect Types (Importance Score: 85)
1. Static Effects
- Solid color fills
- Rainbow gradients
- Color wave patterns

2. Dynamic Effects
- Fire simulation
- Matrix rain effect
- Wave propagation
- Shockwave generation

3. Interactive Effects
- Audio reactive visualizations
- Motion triggered patterns
- Touch responsive animations

## Parameter System (Importance Score: 80)
- Dynamic parameter adjustment
- Real-time value interpolation
- Effect-specific constraints
- Preset management

## Layer Management (Importance Score: 75)
- Multiple effect layer support
- Layer opacity control
- Layer blend mode selection
- Layer ordering and priority

## Color Processing (Importance Score: 70)
- FastLED-inspired palette system
- Color interpolation algorithms
- Dynamic palette transitions
- Custom palette creation

The engine generates frame data that gets transmitted via DDP protocol to physical LED devices, with support for virtual device mapping and segment control.
